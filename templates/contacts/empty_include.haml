      Contacts will automatically be added here as you communicate with them using {{name}}.
      From here you can change a contact's name, organize them into groups and see the communication you've had with each.

    {% url 'contacts.contactimport_create' as contact_import_url %}
    -blocktrans trimmed
      To get started you can %a{href:'{{contact_import_url}}'} import contacts from a file you create in Excel.
